# Moventis Search Results Count Shortcode Plugin

This plugin publishes a shortcode to return the search result count from a search.  
NOTE:  It was created because Elementor does not offer this basic feature in their archive widget for some reason.

## Usage

Simply insert the shortcode [ mov_search_result_count ] without spaces and optionally using the following parameters:

 * tagname:       the HTML tag to wrap the count in.  Default is "span".

e.g., [ mov_search_result_count tagname="span"]
